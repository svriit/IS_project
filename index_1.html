            <h2>Socio-economic Impact of Migration during COVID-19 Crisis in the Sundarbans Region: A Study of Sustainable Solutions using Geo-spatial Analytics</h2><br>
            <p ALIGN=CENTER class="para">The study aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of the problems related to the livelihood of the local population during the COVID 19 crisis, and seek sustainable solutions for the post COVID world. The first part of the project involves detailed assessment of the migration situation and its socio-economic impact in parts of the Sundarbans region through local survey. Together with a local NGO “Sabuj Sangha”, which has been active in the area for more than forty years, we want to create a comprehensive resource map of 10 key villages in the 3 target blocks, viz. Mathurapur II, Patharpratima and Sagar. This survey will be instrumental to capture the regular migration trend, the reverse migration caused by COVID 19, subsequent outward and inward migration dynamics in the region. The project also aims at developing an interactive resource map of the target regions, highlighting available agricultural land, skillsets of local workforce, existing training centres and educational institutions, healthcare facilities, mode of transportation, banks and financial institutions and other resources related to the livelihood of the local population. With the help of local connections of Sabuj Sangha, survey data, and interviewing local people and experts, we will design suggestive models and interventions to create local opportunities. Sustainable livelihood programs such as mangrove nursery formation, animal husbandry, organic farming, pond-based farming etc. may be promoted to train the local youth with necessary knowledge and skills. Objectives
                <br ALIGN=left> 1.Creation of a knowledge base on the socio-economic status of the local population and impact of migration due to COVID 19 crisis in 10 key villages in the 3 target blocks, Mathurapur II, Patharpratima and Sagar in the Sundarban region by means of a detailed survey. 
                <br ALIGN=left>2. Identify the dynamics and underlying factors of regular migration, seasonal migration and reverse migration due to COVID 19, impact on socio economic status. 
                <br ALIGN=left>3. Creation of an interactive resource map from the survey data, satellite images and interviews, and secondary data sources. 4. Hotspot analysis and development of multi-hazard cascade model for the areas affected by the combined effect of the pandemic and natural disasters. 5. Design of intervention strategies to create sustainable opportunities locally.</p>
